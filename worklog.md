## #3

So I finally finished the first draft of my first post... and I just realized as
I saved it that I hadn't talked about the concept of 10x yet. But I spit it all
out in one session which is good. Means that I'll be able to write blog posts in
one session and spend a whole session trimming, linking, and formatting to
improve the polish of things. Super nice to know that I can use a session or two
to squeeze out a blog post. I've got to start writing drafts as often as
possible to fill up the backlog and have a string of things. Perhaps do
something like write 2 a day and edit 1 a day for publishing. Time for my break.
Perhaps I'll write my article on data snowballing next.


## #2

Went to start polishing things and then realized that I wanted to be able to
post my resume in PDF form so I created a layout style that would render PDFs
with a url and tested it with Uncle Bob's Clean Code. I'm satisfied. It will be
nice to have the full PDF version of my resume available on my portfolio.


## #1

Started working on my first blog post and realized the markdown rendering was
not to my liking so I'm trying to get that fixed. I tried to do a markdown link
with text in it and it didn't render properly at all. Also the excerpt just
doesn't seem to be joining lines as normal markdown does which is lame. So I
need to go through and start adjusting everything appropriately. Oh well. Let's
me discover problems.
