Went to start polishing things and then realized that I wanted to be able to
post my resume in PDF form so I created a layout style that would render PDFs
with a url and tested it with Uncle Bob's Clean Code. I'm satisfied. It will be
nice to have the full PDF version of my resume available on my portfolio.

Started working on my first blog post and realized the markdown rendering was
not to my liking so I'm trying to get that fixed. I tried to do a markdown link
with text in it and it didn't render properly at all. Also the excerpt just
doesn't seem to be joining lines as normal markdown does which is lame. So I
need to go through and start adjusting everything appropriately. Oh well. Let's
me discover problems.
