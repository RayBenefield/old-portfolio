Started working on my first blog post and realized the markdown rendering was
not to my liking so I'm trying to get that fixed. I tried to do a markdown link
with text in it and it didn't render properly at all. Also the excerpt just
doesn't seem to be joining lines as normal markdown does which is lame. So I
need to go through and start adjusting everything appropriately. Oh well. Let's
me discover problems.
