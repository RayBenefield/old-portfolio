*This is my first post for the blog and I am excited to be doing this again.  I used to write blog posts regularly back on [Reaching Perfection](http://reachingperfection.com) and I had a real blast doing it. It was mostly around the time when I enjoyed doing game/level design in the Halo community (an Xbox First Person Shooter). And now I get to do it again, but with a huge focus on my career rather than a hobby. This entire blog will be about trying to build stuff faster with a high bar of quality... a sort of developer's version of "Reaching Perfection".*

## Who I am

I grew up as a lazy slacker high school kid who just got by in classes. Sleeping through Calculus, leaving to hang out in other classrooms with friends, etc. Never went to college and joined the military to stay afloat and then slacked for a few years after. Then around 25 I figured out how to re-channel that into efficiency... more value with less effort. And I'm so happy I did.

Now I'm working remotely in Bend, OR, as a Chief Architect for a Fintech AI company based out of New York.I've touched every part of the stack and gained familiarity in it. Started out with mainly data in the Air Force and a real estate data company called IDX. Then picked up APIs, Microservices, and devops at Nike. Then explored innovation projects at Wells Fargo where I picked up node and did some front end on the side. I now have enough experience to truly be a "Full Stack" engineer and architect (I was really missing front end for a while).


## Goals of the Blog

With this blog I'm looking to share my experience and my projects. But more than that I plan to be truly transparent. Earlier this year I truly picked up the [**Pomodoro Technique**](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) as my mode of work. And on top of that, after every 25 minute work session I write a worklog entry. This level of transparency proved to be very valuable early on and I plan to increase my level of transparency by tacking on this blog and also tacking on videos of me actually working in these 25 minute sessions.

I'm expecting to build habits throughout this process that will convert into "series" that are put up on here and on Youtube. The first major series type thing that I'm going is do a "Make a Platform/Package/Product"... or a **M.A.P.** series. Each series will be a playlist of me building things from the ground up in the form of 25 minute videos. One thing I haven't seen much of is end to end software programming videos and I think something like this could be very valuable to people. So we'll see how that starts out. While that happens I also plan on trying to write a post a day on here. We'll see how that goes. lol...


## My Philosophy

One of the things that I feel makes me most unique is my powerful focus on development agility. And not just typing or coding fast. But also designing, deploying, polishing, extending, etc. I LOVE finding ways to streamline my process. Things like Serverless which lets me say no to devops. In particular, Firebase which has a solid *Developer Experience* (DX) compared to AWS with the Serverless framework. Or the choice of NoSQL, to remove the hassle of schemas. And how about functional programming principles that allow me to write stable and re-usable code. Of course this all includes my actual workflow process like the Pomodoro Technique mentioned above.

I've gotten to the point where I can theoretically build a new Platform every single week if I was working full time (40 hours a week). The last thing I worked on had 91 sessions logged (about 38 hours), and it was written in less than 400 lines of code. In the process I also built a new module to improve my functional reactive programming style and I learned Firebase from scratch and built a CLI tool. Real time was over like 3 weeks. It was such a surreal experience and is starting to show all my experience come together in one place to create this unique skillset.


## The End of the Beginning

Again I am pumped to get back to writing. It probably won't be the most entertaining of reads... but I'm going to try to cover some interesting theories, direct to different resources, and provide substantial transparency into how I code. I'm hoping this will prove valuable to somebody at some point. If not, it will still be a good experience for me to build on. Like trying to accomplish front end things on this theme that I found for Hexo. Onwards to the future!
